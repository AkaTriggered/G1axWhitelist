#           G1axWhitelist Configuration
# ========================================
# Professional tier-based auto-whitelist system
# Supports MCTiers and PVPTiers APIs with flexible eligibility

# ========================================
#            ELIGIBILITY SETTINGS
# ========================================
eligibility:
  # Minimum tier value required for each platform
  # Tier Values: 10=HT1, 9=LT1, 8=HT2, 7=LT2, 6=HT3, 5=LT3, 4=HT4, 3=LT4, 2=HT5, 1=LT5, 0=UNRANKED
  # Set to 0 to disable checking for that platform
  mctiers-minimum: 5      # 5 = LT3+ (Default server requirement)
  pvptiers-minimum: 5     # 5 = LT3+ (Fallback requirement)
  
  # Require BOTH platforms to meet minimum OR allow either platform
  # true = Player must be LT3+ on BOTH MCTiers AND PVPTiers
  # false = Player needs LT3+ on EITHER MCTiers OR PVPTiers
  require-both: false
  
  # Advanced: Specific tier whitelist (overrides minimum settings above)
  # Use this for exclusive servers (e.g., only allow HT1-LT2 players)
  # Leave empty to use minimum tier settings instead
  # Example: ["HT1", "LT1", "HT2", "LT2"] = Only allow top 4 tiers
  allowed-tiers: []
